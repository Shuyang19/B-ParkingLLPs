The read.C file is use to read the g_llp ctau data in the root files, 
find the intersection of two different decay length (ctau300 and ctau 1000)
Then can determine a re-weighting factor to extrapolate the behaviour of LLPs at the different decay lengths.

Currently it calculates the intersection of ctau300 and ctau1000 for Pi0Pi0 category
